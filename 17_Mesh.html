<figcaption>Fig17B: A more refined example using filled triangle under certain size. The fill color is chosen randomly from <i>Color</i> and <i>MultiAreaColor</i>. Floodfill is enabled via <i>LineToSurface</i> check box. Area threshold is set by <i>AreaFade</i>.</figcaption>

<h2>Mesh</h2>
<p>
Join particles with straight lines.
</p>
<h3>Slider</h3>
<p>
Transparency: transparent of linking lines and faces.
</p>

<h3>Check box</h3>
<p>
3-Dimensional: Make the mesh looks 3D. Increase joining line count when enabled. If particle has z-movement, the effect will do 3D processing automatically even without this check box ticked.
</p>

<h3>Setting dialog</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Color
  <ul><li>Color for line and face.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shape
  <ul><li>The shape that make up the joining lines. However, the shape can hardly be identified when Intvl is 1.</li></ul>
  </li>
	<li>LineWidth
  <ul><li>Width of lines linking particles.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Intvl
  <ul><li>Separation among successive shapes in a joining line.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Split concurrent
  <ul><li>Only links particles that are emitted at the same moment. To be used with the concurrent option in ParticleRender.</li></ul>
  </li>
    <li>LineToSurface
  <ul><li>Fill enclosed area instead of drawing lines only. The area are all triangle. See Fig17B for example.</li></ul>
  </li>
    <li>AreaFade
  <ul>
  <li>Applies fade-out or fade-in to filled faces.</li>
  <li>The value needs to be &gt 2000 in order to have any visible effect. </li>
  <li>+ve value: A triangle fade-out as it approaches the size as defined by this value. The triangle disappear completely when its area exceeds this value.</li>
  <li>-ve value: A triangle fade-in as it approaches the size as defined by this value. The triangle is opaque when its area exceeds this value. </li>
  </ul>

    <li>FadeAlpha
  <ul><li>Final transparency of a filled triangle.</li></ul>
  </li>
    <li>MultiAreaColor
  <ul><li>A list of flood fill color candidates. The filling color is taken from this field and the color set in the <i>Color</i> field. See Fig17B for reference.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sync alpha
  <ul><li>Multiply the alpha values from ParticleRender with the transparency setting in this effect.</li></ul>
